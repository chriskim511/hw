- HashSet implements set, only non duplicate elements -overrides equals() and hashcode() -stores only objects -uses add() method to add elements ***slower than HashMap
- HashMap implements  map, -duplicate keys not allowed but allows null values and null keys -not sychronized -uses the put() method to add an element to the map
- TreeMap implements map, maintains order of objects, unlike HashMap. As usual, it stores a key and a value -duplicates allowed
- TreeSet implements set, stores only one object, duplicates not allowed and it's sorted
- TreeMap slower than Hashmap, treeset slower than hashset
- Java's builtin heap is HeapPriorityQueue
