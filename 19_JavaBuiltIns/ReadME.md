- HashSet implements set, only non duplicate elements, it overrides equals() and hashcode() and stores only objects -uses add() method to add elements
- HashMap implements  map, -duplicate keys not allowed but allows null values and null keys, it uses the put() method to add an element to the map
- TreeMap implements map, maintains order of objects, unlike HashMap. As usual, it stores a key and a value -duplicates allowed
- TreeSet implements set, stores only one object, duplicates not allowed and it's sorted
- TreeMap slower than Hashmap, treeset slower than hashset set slower than map
- Java's builtin heap is HeapPriorityQueue
