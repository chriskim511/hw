I was unable to do the hw QuickSort tonight because I was extremely pressed with work, and my brain can’t seem to function
for CS at this time of the night. I’ll definitely have it done by tomorrow night, and I’m really sorry for this.
Thank you for being so understanding, and although I'll be missing class tomorrow for the AIME I'll be sure to 
catch up on everything and submit whatever hws you assign tomorrow as well as todays.
